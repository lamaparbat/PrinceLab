                <h3>Alterations</h3>
                <p>We can make changes to this privacy notice from time to time.
                    The changes we make on this page will be identified first.
                    We will send a notice to you, in circumstances where a
                    change will materially change the way in which We collect
                    or use your personal information or data via emails or
                    texts and you shall have a right to object to any such
                    update and/or amendment or withdraw your consent.</p>
                <h3>Personal Data</h3>
                <p>The terms “personal data” or “personal information” mean
                    any information about an individual for which that person
                    can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).
                    We may collect and process personal data that you voluntarily
                    give Us when you use Our website. For example, you may use this
                    Website to contact Us with questions and comments. When you
                    fill out the contact Us form on Our website, you provide Us
                    with personal information such as your name and email address
                    or phone number.In addition to the information you provide when
                    you use Our website, We may use technology to collect aggregated
                    data such as statistical data. Aggregated data may be derived
                    from your personal data but is not considered personal data
                    in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal
                    your identity. For example, We may aggregate your usage of
                    Our website to calculate the percentage of users accessing
                    a specific website feature. However, if We combine or connect
                    aggregated data with your personal data so that it can
                    directly or indirectly identify you, We treat the combined
                    data as personal data which will be used in accordance with
                    this notice.</p>
                <h3>How we use your data</h3>
                <p>When you fill the contact Us form on this website, We use the personal
                    information submitted in the form only to respond to your message or
                    act on your request. This personal information will not be kept longer
                    than necessary and will be deleted once the feedback requirement is
                    met. The provision of your personal data is not a statutory or contractual
                    requirement. You are not obliged to provide Us any personal data and it is
                    your choice whether to provide Us. Only minimal personal data is collected
                    when you fill the contact Us form on this website, namely your name and email
                    address. Without provision of such personal data, We will not be in a position
                    to respond to your message or act on your request. You may withdraw your
                    consent to the processing of your personal data at any time. Such withdrawal
                    does not affect the legality of any processing based on your consent prior
                    withdrawal.</p>
                <h3>Third party links</h3>
                <p>This website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and
                    applications. It is important to note that clicking on those links
                    or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or
                    share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites
                    and are not responsible for their privacy policies.
                </p>
                <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
                <p>Prince lab uses cookies to give you the best online experience. By
                    using our website you agree to our use of cookies in accordance with
                    our cookie policy.
                </p>
                <h3>Information Sharing</h3>
                <p>As a general rule, any information gathered through the use of Our
                    website is used solely by Us and, save as otherwise permitted herein
                    and/or required by law, will not be transferred to third parties.
                    We may, however, have to share your personal data with the parties
                    set out below:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Selected individuals within Our company;</li>
                        <li>Our intra-group companies and affiliates; and</li>
                        <li>Our agents and third parties that provide services to Us.</li>
                    </ol>
                    We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal
                    data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow Our
                    third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own
                    purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for
                    specified purposes and in accordance with Our instructions.
                </p>
                <h3>Location Tracking</h3>
                <p>In February of 2015, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) expanded their
                    guidelines for mobile app developers who create apps that collect
                    user data, specifically user location data. This expansion builds
                    upon the original guidance published by the FTC in February of 2013
                    in their report "Mobile Privacy Disclosures: Building Trust through
                    Transparency". A recently settled lawsuit initiated by the FTC shows
                    that these guidelines should not be disregarded by app developers
                    without the risk of being charged with deceptive practices.
                    However, the main reasons why WE track users are to gain insights
                    about how they use our site, to provide a personalized online
                    experience, and to monetize the user by showing them targeted
                    adverts.
                </p>
                <h3>Your Rights</h3>
                <p>
                    For as long as We retain your personal data, you have certain rights

                        <li>Right to Object – you have a right to object and request that
                            We cease the processing of your personal data where We rely
                            on Our, or a third party’s legitimate interest for processing
                            your personal data.
                        </li>
                        <li>Right to Rectification – you have the right to update or

                            your personal data or the personal data that We hold about you is inaccurate.
                        </li>
                        <li>Right to withdraw your consent – where Our processing is based on your consent, you have the
                            right to withdraw your consent. Withdrawal of your consent shall not affect the lawfulness
                            of the processing based on your consent prior to the withdrawal of your consent.
                        </li>
                        <li>Right to be informed of the source – where the personal data We hold about you was not
                            provided to Us directly by you, you may also have the right to be informed of the source
                            from which your personal data originates.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    Please note that in terms of the applicable laws, your rights in relation to your personal data are

                    will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.

                    If you consider that Our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you
                    have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data
                    protection.
