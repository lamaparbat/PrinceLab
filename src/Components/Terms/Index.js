                    infringing work; (c) a written statement that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is
                    not authorized by the owner, its agent or the law; (d) your name and contact information, including
                    telephone number and email address; and (e) a statement by you that the above information in your

                <p>
                    You may terminate your agreement and close your account with Prince Lab at any time, effective the
                    last day of your subscription term, by sending an email to support@princelab.com. Prince Lab may

                    Products, and/or Services at any time, including the use of any software, (i) if you breach these
                    Terms and/or any other agreement with Prince Lab; (ii) if Prince Lab reasonably suspects that you
                    are using the Website, Products, and/or Services to breach the law or infringe third party rights;
                    (iii) if Prince Lab reasonably suspects that you are trying to unfairly exploit or misuse Prince
                    Lab’s policies; (iv) if Prince Lab reasonably suspects that you are using the Website, Products,
                    and/or Services fraudulently, or that Products or Services provided to you are being used by a third
                    party fraudulently; (v) if you fail to pay any amounts due to Prince Lab; (vi) you violate any
                    applicable law or regulation. Upon termination of your Prince Lab account for the above reasons,
                    there will be no refund of fees and you will be denied access to the Website, Products and/or the
                    Services, including all of its data. <br/><br/>
                    Prince Lab may terminate any agreement and access to your account, if the Services or any part
                    thereof, are no longer legally available in your jurisdiction, or are no longer commercially viable,
                    at Prince Lab’s sole discretion. In case of termination or closing of your account by you because of
                    a material breach by Prince Lab, without any default by you, or in case of a force majeure on the
                    side of Prince Lab, Prince Lab will refund pro rata for the remaining period of your subscription
                    any fees or expenses paid by you.<br/> <br/>
                    If you believe that Prince Lab has failed to perform or the Services are defective, you must notify
                    Prince Lab in writing and allow fourteen (14) days for Prince Lab to cure the defect. If Prince Lab
                    cures the defect within this cure period, Prince Lab will not be in default and cannot be held
                    liable for any damages and/or losses in connection to such default. If Prince Lab has not cured the
                    defect within this cure period, you may terminate the subscription with immediate effect, upon
                    written notice to Prince Lab.
